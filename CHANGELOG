05.06.2013, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp-Stellaris 0.1 experimental:

  I am very happy to announce Mecrisp-Stellaris !
  This is the very first beginning, expect monsters inside.

  As this is the younger sister of Mecrisp for MSP430,
  they share their development history and most design ideas.


12.06.2013, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp-Stellaris 0.2 experimental:

  - Unicode support
  - First interrupt handler for Systick-Timer
  - Lots of small changes
  - Ledcomm ported

15.06.2013, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp-Stellaris 0.3 experimental:

  - Recognizes both LF and CR as line ending
  - Uses hardware FIFO buffer for serial communication
  - Enables GPIO hardware on startup
  - Tidied up internal register usage
  - Faster interrupt entry
  - Fetch-Modify-Store definitions are now interrupt safe
  - Mecrisp-Stellaris now generates smaller code
  - Tidied up debug messages
  - Lots of small changes

23.06.2013, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp-Stellaris 0.4 experimental:

  - Examples in Forth for Analog, Timer, PWM and Interrupts
  - Interrupt handling for Ports and Timers included
  - Tidied up source code
  - Core needs less RAM
  - Lots of small changes
